# Green-Roots
Volunteer Tree Planting Platform. (Green Roots) 
As deforestation and environmental degradation 
continue to escalate, there is an urgent need for community engagement in tree planting efforts. 
This project aims to create a digital platform that connects volunteers with local tree planting 
initiatives. By facilitating communication, we tackle the challenge of mobilizing community 
members to participate in reforestation activities.
